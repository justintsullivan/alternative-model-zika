In this paper, an alternative to an existing deterministic model for Zika Virus is proposed. In the original model, individual measures to protect against the virus are taken into account via a constant transfer rate from the susceptible population to the recovered population. The proposed model accounts for these measures via limiting parameters attached to the transmission probability of the virus; one parameter limits the probability of vector transmission through the use of PPE, while the other limits the probability of sexual transmission. The proposed model possesses a disease-free equilibrium that is locally, asymptotically stable when the basic reproductive number is less than one. In order to compare the efficacy of the new model to that of the original, both systems were given identical parameter values and their graphs and point-estimates were compared. For reasonable values of the new limiting parameters, both models produce nearly-identical graphs and point estimates. In addition, for identical parameter values and initial conditions, elasticity analysis determined that the limiting parameter associated with the probability of vector-transmission was far more influential on the new system than the parameter used in the original model.
